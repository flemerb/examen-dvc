## 4. Submission  
To submit the exam on the platform, you will send a .zip file containing an .md file with your name, first name, email address, and the link to your DagsHub repository. Then, share your repository with https://dagshub.com/licence.pedago, adding them as a collaborator with read-only access. To validate the exam, we expect to find in this repository:  

The 5 preprocessing, modeling, and model evaluation scripts detailed in step 1.  
- A `.dvc` folder with a config file specifying information about the remote location.  
- A `.pkl` file in the _models_ tab of DagsHub with the trained model.  
- A `.json` file in the metrics folder with the evaluation metrics of the model.  
- A `dvc.yaml` file with the DVC pipeline steps, along with a dvc.lock file containing the backup information.  
- The `_data_` tab should display the data properly.
